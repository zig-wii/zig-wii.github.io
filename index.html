      <h1>Welcome to zig-wii project!</h1>
      <p>
        <code>zig-wii</code> is a collection of toolchains and libraries for the
        Nintendo Wii combined together using the Zig language. It is mainly an
        effort to make it as simple as possible for anyone to start developing
        games and applications targeting the Wii.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started with development, make sure you have Zig and Dolphin installed
        on your computer. Next, run the following commands, which should build
        the example project provided by <code>zig-wii</code> and run it in Dolphin:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          git clone https://github.com/zig-wii/example
          cd example/
          zig build run
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        That's right, the only dependencies you need are Zig and Git for building
        the .dol file, and optionally Dolphin for running. <code>zig-wii</code>
        takes care of installing devkitpro for your operating system (currently
        supports Linux, MacOS and Windows) so you don't have to deal with that
        manually. You can also deploy the .dol file to your Wii over the network
        if you have the homebrew channel. To do so, find the ip address of your
        Wii, then change following line in <code>build.zig</code>:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          var obj = try ogc.target_wii(builder, .{ .name = "example" });
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        into this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          var obj = try ogc.target_wii(builder, .{ .name = "example", .wii_ip = "192.168.11.171" });          
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now you can run <code>zig build deploy</code> to automatically build and
        deploy the .dol file over to your Wii. If you encounter a stack dump while
        developing, use <code>zig build line -- &lt;addresses&gt;</code> to find out
        where in the code the stack dump occured.
